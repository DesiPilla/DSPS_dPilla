Group members: Cat Harty, Theodore Fessaras, Melvin Tejada, Samuel Matylewicz, Desi Pilla

Our group met to complete this assignment. I (Desi) wrote most of the functions required for the lab. Cat Harty wrote the docstrings and completed the derivation for the velocity-radius relationship. Sam Matylewicz, Melvin Tejada, and Theodore Fessaras all helped understand the requirements of the lab and fix bugs and errors as they popped up.
