# READING: 

Read the Sessions 1 and 2 of [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf).

Work in groups of 3 to 5 people. 

Remember to include a README.md, in markdown format, that states how your team worked: who you worked with and what you contributed specifically.

# 1. sampling

Finishe the lab started in class.  The lab is uploaded in [lab3](https://github.com/fedhere/DSPS/blob/master/lab3/labPI_inclass.ipynb) both a coopy of hte notebook worked in class and a slighty more refined one I prepared.


# 2. Uncerainties and Dark Matter 

follow the instructions in the notebook [GalrotCurve.ipynb](GalrotCurve.ipynb)

# 3. 667 students (and extra credit for 467)

Problem 1 in [Hogg and Foreman-Mackey 2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06068.pdf). You cannot choose: Gaussian, Poisson, or Binomial. Any other distribution is fine. Make sure that your chosen disrtibution has defined mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis! (e.g. of a distribution with non defined is the Cauchy distribution, which is my favorite. Ask me why if you are curious!)
