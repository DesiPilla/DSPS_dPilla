# Data Science for Physical Scientists
In my senior year at the University of Delaware, I enrolled in the course Data Science for Physical Scientists
(PHYS 467). The instructor was Dr. Federica Bianca. While the labs were completed in groups, I have personally
learned all concepts demonstrated in each assignment. The class repository can be found [here](https://github.com/fedhere/DSPS).

## Labs
The homework consisted of the following labs:
1. Understand the basics of GitHub.
2. Exploring different statistical distributions and how to create them in python.
    * Normal, binomial, poisson, cauchy,  and log-normal distibutions
    * NumPy package
    * Plotting using matplotlib.pyplot
3. Recreate the data analysis from the PhD thesis 'Statistical Tests for Scaling in the Inter-Event Times of Earthquakes in California' by Alvaro Corral.
    * Data collection and cleaning
    * Pandas package
    * Broadcasting a panda dataframe
    * Data analysis
4. Testing the Significance of Dark Matter
    * Uncertainty analysis
    * Propogation of error
    * Astropy package (units)
    * Errorbars
