# HW5

Group members: Cat Harty, Theodore Fessaras, Melvin Tejada, Samuel Matylewicz, Desi Pilla

We split up to complete this assignment. Samuel and I (Desi) met and worked together, while Cat, Theodore, and Melvin met separately
to work on the lab. We all communicated to troubleshoot issues and debug our code. Each member did every part of the lab, through 
collaboration with the rest of the group.
