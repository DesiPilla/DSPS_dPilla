## Improvements:

1. The font size of the numbers in the ticks for the x and y lines look very small compared to the size of the labels of each variable and to the size of the title. 
2. It is confusing to understand what the graph is trying to communicate since the launch angle appears to be a dependent variable of the exit speed, but I assume that the launch angle is also an independent variable and the probability depends on these two independent variables. To improve this, I imagined that I rotated the graph 90 degrees to put the probability at the top and the other two variables on the x and y axis.
3. Thereâ€™re a lot of data points in the graph that can be omitted without losing clarity. The first impression is that the image feels saturated due to all the purple dots throughout the entire figure. Reducing the y limits of the graph where there are not a lot of purple data points.

## Quality:

I think the plot has very good use of space, there is no unnecessary space. It does a great job in contrasting the colors to make the differences very
