# Review done Victor Ramirez Delgado:

## Improvements:

1. The font size of the numbers in the ticks for the x and y lines look very small compared to the size of the labels of each variable and to the size of the title. I think it would be a good idea to increase their font size to make them easier to read.

2. I find it confusing to understand the graph because there are three different variables represented in the plot. I'm confused on what the graph is trying to communicate since the first thing I read about the graph is its tittle saying that it shows the batted balls probability, but the x axis shows the exit velocity and the y axis is its launch angle. This makes me believe that the launch angle is also a dependent variable of the exit speed, but I'm assuming that what Desi is trying to show is that the launch angle is also an independent variable and the probability depends on these two independent variables. In order to get to this conclusion, I imagined that I rotated the graph 90 degrees to put the probability at the top and the other two variables on the x and y axis to understand it better. To improve this, I would follow my previous reasoning and rotate the graph to clarify their correlation.

3. I think there are a lot of data points in the graph and I think that some of them can just be omitted and the graph would still communicate the same message. The first impression is that the image fells very saturated because there are a lot of purple dots throughout the entire figure, but there is only a small section in the upper left that the difference in the probability can be seen. To improve this, I would reduce the lower and upper y limits of the graph where there are not a lot of purple data points.

## Quality:

I think the plot has very good use of space, there is not a lot of blank and unnecessary space in it and it does a great job in contrasting the colors of data points; I think it was a good choice of colors to make the least probable to be the more transparent ones and the more likely to be in yellow because it is very easy to distinguish their differences.
