![MLB Batted Balls Hit Probability - June 2019](https://github.com/DesiPilla/DSPS_dPilla/new/master/HW8/mlbplot.png)
This chart plots the launch angle of a baseball vs. its exit velocity for all batted balls during the month of June 2019. The colors display the balls likelhood of being a hit, with a darker hue representing a higher likelihood of a hit. The most noticeable trend is that balls with lower velocities need to be hit with a more ideal launch angle (45 degrees) to be considered a hit, while harder-hit balls can be hit at lower angles and have the same probability of being a hit.
