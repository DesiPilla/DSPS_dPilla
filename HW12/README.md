# Assignment 1
I worked through assignment mainly by myself. Our group consulted with each other, but we did not meet up explicitly to work on the assignment.

# Assignment 2
**Original Image**

![Original Image](https://github.com/DesiPilla/DSPS_dPilla/blob/master/HW12/PenguinsShouting.jpg)

**Rendered Image**

![Deep Dream Image](https://github.com/DesiPilla/DSPS_dPilla/blob/master/HW12/outfile.jpg)

This photo really creeps me out. The deep dream model took a perfectly lovely photo and found big creep eyes and put them all over this image. Though the eyes seem to be surrounded by dog-like faces, this render really freaks me out.

In some renders of the image, wolves appeared to manifest themselves in the picture. In other renders, peacocks appeared to manifest themselves in the picture. While the original image did contain animals (penguins), there would be no logical reason to interpret wolves and peacocks in the locations that they showed up in. The reason these animals were manifested is because the deep dream model was trained to find and distinguish animals in pictures. Each time the model combs over an image, it becomes even more certain that an animal exists in the photo, even though it doesn't.
